    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the last laboratories, it is not obvious to get the tip of the finger to follow a given movement, such as a circle. Last laboratory you computed the forward kinematics of the robot, which provides the position of the fingertip given the measured joint angles. In this laboratory, we will use this function to do the inverse: find joint positions that will realize a desired fingertip position.\n",

    "## Inverse Geometry / Inverse Kinematics Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse geometry problem is the following: given a desired fingertip position (given in the S frame) $p_{SF} = (x_{des},y_{des}, z_{des})$, can we find joint angles $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ that would attain this position (if they exist)? Denoting $p_{FK}(\\theta)$ the (forward kinematics) function that returns the fingertip position, given a joint angle configuration, our problem is to find the vector of joint angles $\\theta$ that solves the equation\n",
    "$$p_{FK}(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{des}\\\\ y_{des}\\\\ z_{des} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

    "**Key Take Away - Inverse Geometry determines the joint positions of the robot using the given tip location**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recasting the problem as an optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in class that solutions to this equation are also solutions to the following optimization problem\n",
    "$$\\min_{\\theta} \\left(p_{FK}(\\theta) - \\begin{pmatrix} x_{des}\\\\ y_{des}\\\\ z_{des} \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^2$$\n",
    "when we attain 0 as a minimum. When 0 is not attained, we get the \"closest\" possible solution, i.e. the attainable fingertip position that is closest to the desired one (when the desired one is not attainable)."
