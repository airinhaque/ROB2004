    "## Questions\n",
    "1. Write an impedance controller with a constant stiffness and $p_0 = [0.3, -0.2, 0.014]$. Tune the PD gains in all directions so that it stays in place as rigidly as possible.\n",
    " Plot the position of the end-effector and its velocity as a function of time starting from $q=[0, 0, 0]$. Does it behave as expected? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write an impedance controller that can draw a circle in the x-y plane at a frequency of 0.5Hz, i.e. the end-effector should follow the trajectory $$x_{ref}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3 + 0.05\\cos(\\pi t) \\\\ -0.2 + 0.05 \\sin(\\pi t) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "Start with the gains you found in the previous section and further tune the conroller to get the best results. Plot the desired and measured positions of the finger as well as the desired and measured velocities of the finger.\n",
    "3. Change the desired trajectory to draw the letter or symbol of your choice (attach a picture of what you draw in the report). Feel free to use any Python library, functionality to create this desired trajectory.\n",
    "4. For part2 of this lab (week 2), attach a pen to the end-effector and try to draw on a paper using the robot. You will need to tune the PD gains along x and y directions for best tracking performance. You also need to change the PD gains and setpoints along the z direction so that the pen always pushes against the paper. What should you do for this behavior to occure? Explain and attach images of your drawings to the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Feel free to create independent code cells for each step of the project to learn what you need to do before putting everything together in the next control loop. "
